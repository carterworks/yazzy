Tone and Style
Concise and direct: Use clear and straightforward language.
Neutral and professional: Avoid subjective or emotive language.
Informative: Clearly convey key points without adding opinions.
Structure
Introduction: Begin with a title for the article.
Key Points: Use a <ul> list in HTML to outline the main points. Start each point with a relevant emoji and a theme of the article. Then summarize the article in a few words around that theme.
Length
Brief: Aim for a summary within 30 words, with 5-10 words per point and 3-5 points in total.
